title: "Grant timelines from my first year as faculty"
excerpt: "It's been roughly one year since my lab received its first grant. As I begin putting together the Research Performance Progress Report to highlight our progress so far, I also wanted to reflect on the timeframes for receiving this grants in the first place. As a new faculty, I didn't realize how long it would actually take for a grant to be reviewed and considered for funding. So below are the timelines for each grant I submitted from submission to its eventual award or lack thereof. I hope that these timelines will be helpful for new PIs starting out."

It's been roughly one year since my lab received its first grant. As I begin putting together the Research Performance Progress Report to highlight our progress so far, I also wanted to reflect on the timeframes for receiving this grants in the first place. As a new faculty, I didn't realize how long it would actually take for a grant to be reviewed and considered for funding. So below are the timelines for each grant I submitted from submission to its eventual award or lack thereof. I hope that these timelines will be helpful for new PIs starting out.

(As a side note: I started as a tenure-track faculty at an R1 institution in the United States in July of 2020. I was recruited in 2019 but deferred my start date by a year in order to finish up some post-doctoral work. This extra time also allowed me to recruit a post-doc, establish collaborations, prepare grants, and then submit these grants as soon as I got started so take my grant submission dates relative to my start date in this context.)

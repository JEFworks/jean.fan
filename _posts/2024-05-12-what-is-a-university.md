<i>At this critical moment in history, let this reflection serve as a snapshot in time of my evolving thoughts, to document the events around me as I've experienced them. </i>

Ongoing world-wide anti-war protests have erupted on university campuses with the broad goal of establishingnew productive standards regarding university investments and relationships. Some protests have ended peacefully with [successful negotiation between protestors and university administration](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/7/pro-palestine-protests-how-some-universities-reached-deals-with-students), while others have been met with violence and the forcible removal of students and faculty by police. 

Here at Hopkins, much like at many universities, [some faculty have engaged](https://twitter.com/LesterSpence/status/1786768651921604781) to build bridges between students and administration to encourage dialogue, engagement, and de-escalation. Still, such an experience has highlighted for me the importance of all the hidden labor towards building and mending smaller bridges among faculty, among students, and among administration. I am humbled by discussions among faculty with diverse perspectives and the willingness of some to sit with temporary discomfort in order to come to common ground regarding these complex and emotional issues. But I am also saddened by the fear that I have witnessed percolating in the absence of trustworthy information and communication. I am frustrated by condescending ad hominem attacks towards students and an unwillingness to engage with the premise underlying their demands: why do some universities have multi-million to billion dollar endowments that are invested without the knowledge or input from its very stakeholders, including its students (and faculty)?

Today, the [encampment at Hopkins has come to a peaceful resolution](https://twitter.com/hopkins4justice/status/1789521015854301360) with an agreement for an accelerated Public Interest Investment Advisory Committee (PIIAC) review process. Historically, such [student-led divestment campaigns through the PIIAC has contributed to the divestment of university funds from publicly traded companies operating in apartheid South Africa as well as total divestment from tobacco companies](https://provost.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PIIAC-Report-final.pdf). As the hard work of holding administration accountable to their promises through engagement, dialogue, and de-escalation continues, I am left to reflect: what is a university and who should it serve?

What is a university?   
And who does it serve?  

Is it an institution of higher education,  
Serving the learning goals of the next generation,  
Preparing them with the critical thinking and specialized skills  
To make meaningful contributions to something bigger than themselves?  

Is it an incubator for research,  
Serving the public interest using taxpayer dollars,  
Pushing the boundaries of knowledge and innovation  
To enable breakthrough discoveries for the benefit of all?  

Or is it (paraphrased from https://twitter.com/jwillia2/status/1788896484450029999):  
"a hedge fund attached to a real-estate empire,  
Serving the pockets of a select few billionaire donors,  
Prioritizing the efficient maximization of financial returns,   
To produce weapons for the military-surveillance state"?  

[A combination of the above?  Something else entirely?]  

So let me ask you:  
What is a university?   
And who should it serve?
